## What is this?
This is a repo containing scripts I wrote to solve problems in daily life that are kind of similar to online coding challenges. Most of the programs will be pretty short, and I may or may not optimize them in the future.

## What scripts are on here?

So far, the following scripts are on here:
- quizlet-sucks.py -> an alternative to quizlet, similar to anki flashcards, programmed so I can study AP biology vocabulary words. The program tells you how to use it's syntax. I provided the file 'vocab4.txt' for anyone that just wants to try the program out. 

## Coming soon:
- quizlet-sucks *part two* -> Add a multiple choice option, and functionality similar to the "learn" option on quizlet, which gets locked by a paywall after a few rounds.
